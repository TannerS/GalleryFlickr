Network Layer:

used retrofit to be able to make the async call to flickr using a callback

I also used json parsing by faster xml jackson to store the data into a model object

Display layer:

it would update the grideview with the data object (model objects) that was saved by the network layer and display them

Challenges:

I was not able to finish adding the title to the UI as I would like since I ran into a eror with the format of the API call and malformed jason being returned

I also not able to use a fully sized image due to a problem on flickr url return
